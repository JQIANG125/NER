Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B
but O
not O
any O
longer O

We O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O

The O
food B
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B
tiny O

After O
all O
that O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O

Avoid O
this O
place B

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
many O
times O
the O
food B
is O
always O
consistently O
outrageously O
good O

Saul B
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O

The O
duck O
confit O
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B
gras I
terrine I
with I
figs I
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O

For O
the O
price O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B
attendant I
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O

Food B
was O
okay O
nothing O
great O

Chow B
fun I
was O
dry O
pork B
shu I
mai I
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O

I O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B
again O

Went O
on O
a O
NUM O
day O
oyster O
binge O
with O
Fish B
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O

Service B
was O
devine O
oysters B
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
and O
the O
price O
can't O
be O
beat O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B
Saul I
on O
Smith O
Street O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
the O
decor B
cool O
and O
understated O

I O
had O
the O
duck B
breast I
special I
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O

Can't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try' O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I'll O
ever O
go O
back O

The O
food B
is O
very O
averagethe O
Thai B
fusion I
stuff I
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B
Chicken I
special I
with I
Edamame I
Puree I

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B
pureed I
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O

Anyways O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
I O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O

The O
decor O
is O
night O
thobut O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent O
in O
the O
ceilingits O
quite O
un-appetizing O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O

Their O
sake B
list I
was O
extensive O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
which O
wasn't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O

The O
spicy B
tuna I
roll I
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B
shrimp I
tempura I
was O
awesome O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O

We O
went O
around O
NUM O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B
was O
great O

we O
love O
th O
pink B
pony I

THe O
perfect O
spot B

Food B
- O
awesome O

Service B
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O

Ambiance B
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O

Don't O
judge O
this O
place B
prima O
facie O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O

i O
hang O
out O
and O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

the O
food B
is O
decent O

however O
it's O
the O
service B
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B
intimidate O
me O
ie O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
or O
the O
check O

i O
know O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O

well O
i O
didn't O
find O
it O
there O
and O
trust O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
hmmm O

This O
place B
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O

Food B
is O
great O

Service B
is O
top O
notch O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin I
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
creamy O
and O
slightly O
buttery O

The O
sushi B
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O

The O
rice B
to I
fish I
ration I
was O
also O
good O
- O
they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B
price I
sushi I
deal I
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O

In O
the O
evening O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
with O
it O
NY O
crowd B

The O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O

I'm O
going O
back O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
romantic O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
yet O
unimposing O
the O
food B
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O

The O
Prix B
Fixe I
menu I
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O

I've O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

It O
is O
terrific O
as O
is O
the O
value O

NUM O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B
were O
great O

Frankly O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O

The O
food B
here O
is O
rather O
good O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B
chai I
and O
the O
chole B
but O
the O
dhosas B
and O
dhal B
were O
kinda O
disappointing O

The O
service B
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they're O
very O
nice O
and O
sometimes O
not O

The O
kitchen B
however O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O

Also O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don't O

The O
ambience B
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
NUM O
bday O

If O
you've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O

The O
lava B
cake I
dessert I
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B
you're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
off-the-beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O

The O
food B
was O
average O
to O
above-average O
the O
French B
Onion I
soup I
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
and O
the O
desserts B
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O

However O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B
and O
consider O
the O
food B
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
however O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O

The O
pizza B
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O

The O
pizza B
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O

Yes O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
don't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B
right O

A O
big O
disappointment O
all O
around O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O

The O
seafood B
is O
amazing O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B
list I
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O

Best O
Pastrami B
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B
without O
being O
ridiculous O

And O
I've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B
shrimp I
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
I've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
NUM O
years O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B

This O
place B
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O

The O
signs B
the O
specials B
menus I
food I
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O

This O
place B
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O

I O
am O

Leon B
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem: O
casual O
but O
hip O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French O
bistro O
fare O
good O
specials B
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
staff B
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O

Decent O
wine B
at O
reasonable O
prices O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
too O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B
Pomodori I

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B
in O
the O
neighborhood O

The O
service B
is O
excellent O
the O
decor B
is O
great O
and O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B

You'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare O

I'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B

This O
place B
is O
incredibly O
tiny O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
NUM O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O

The O
hostess B
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O

The O
food B
was O
bland O
oily O

I O
just O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B
wine I
and O
service B

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B
of I
wine I
while O
we O
waited O

When O
we O
sat O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B

The O
people B
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B
to O
go O
to O

The O
pizza B
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B

But O
the O
pizza B
is O
way O
to O
expensive O

A O
large O
is O
NUM O
and O
toppings O
are O
about O
NUM O
each O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O

Sauce B
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B
didn't O
have O
much O
flavor O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O

This O
place B
is O
great O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O

The O
waitress B
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B
is O
phenomenal O

Service B
was O
prompt O
friendly O
and O
great O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O

Great O
pizza B
and O
fantastic O
service B

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O

I O
will O
be O
back O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O

The O
place B
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B
is O
fantastic O

Get O
the O
tuna B
of I
gari I

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

Planet O
Thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
 I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B
which O
is O
great O
 the O
thai B
food I
is O
excellent O
too O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B
 I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O

The O
atmosphere B
isn't O
the O
greatest O
 but O
I O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O

It's O
all O
about O
the O
food B

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O

those O
rolls B
were O
big O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B
wasn't O
fresh O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
i O
didn't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O

Hurley's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O

Try O
the O
crunchy B
tuna I
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
it O
is O
all O
good O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
enough O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B
terrace I

The O
food B
was O
amazing O
and O
the O
service B
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
but O
not O
over-bearing O
or O
rushed O

The O
Steak B
Tartare I
is O
a O
great O
bet O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
but O
the O
open B
kitchen I
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O

Great O
wine B
selection I
Gigondas I
is O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
the O
house B
champagne I
is O
a O
great O
value O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
but O
the O
vibe B
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B
food I
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place B
to O
friends O
always O
gets O
good O
response O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza O
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
- O
the O
crust B
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
freshly O
baked O
bread O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy's O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT's B

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
lonk O
dined O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B
and O
has O
great O
food B

I've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O

I'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B
and O
nice O
service B

I'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B
very O
much O
and O
we're O
repeat O
customers O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B
Scallop I
roll I

it's O
delicious O

Moules B
were O
excellent O
lobster B
ravioli I
was O
VERY O
salty O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother's O
Day O
and O
the O
maitre B
d' I
was O
pretty O
rude O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O

Tiny O
dessert B
was O
NUM O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O

The O
drinks B
are O
always O
well O
made O
and O
wine B
selection I
is O
fairly O
priced O

Try O
their O
chef's B
specials I
- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O

Service B
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O

Downstairs B
lounge I
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

Raga's B
is O
a O
romantic O
cozy O
restaurant O

The O
exotic B
food I
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O

The O
staff B
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O

The O
bar B
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B
and O
well O
priced O
wines B

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O

The O
waitress B
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
we O
were O
told O
no O

Then O
to O
top O
things O
off O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O

Such O
a O
disappointment O

Rude O

a O
great O
time O
at O
Jekyll B
and I
Hyde I

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B
and O
actors B

Our O
server B
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O

The O
food B
was O
good O
too O

The O
tuna B
and O
wasabe B
potatoes I
are O
excellent O

The O

go O
by O
NUM O
feet O
away O
on O
NUM O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O

wonderful O

Inside O

a O
little O
cramped O
but O
to O
be O
expected O

Service B
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O

and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O

Great O
service B
great O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O

hands-down O

But O

far O
east O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy's O
frequently O

The O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B
mozzarella I
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
frozen O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B
selection I
stinks O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O

Also O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O

Wait B
staff I
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B
on O
the O
UWS O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B
I O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O

I O
accidently O
found O
this O

to O
see O
the O

the O
perfect O
quiet O
relaxing O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O

The O
chicken B

delictable O
and O
the O

professional O
wan O
warm O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid-town O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O

The O

The O

while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
NUM O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
LA O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
 
For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don't O
know O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B
Hand I
roll I
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
youIT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
the O
chef O
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
Fatty O
Yellow O
Tail O
Boton O
Shrimp O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
Fatty O
Tuna O
Sea O
Eel O
etc O

The O
sake B
menu I
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O

All O
in O
all O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O

Try O
the O
lobster B
teriyaki I
and O
the O
rose B
special I
roll I

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
NUM O
menu O

Service B
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive O

Food B
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B
belly I
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience O

Wine B
list I
selection I
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass B
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O

Traditional B
French I
decour I
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O

I've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B
Spice I
probably O
NUM O
times O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O

To O
sum O
it O
up: O
Service B
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O

Seating B
is O
always O
prompt O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O

Food B
is O
usually O
very O
good O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B
vegatables I
in I
side I
orders I

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O

The O
decor B
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B
boths I
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B
Eye I

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B
jazz I
band I
and O
atmosphere B
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O

I've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menuthere's O
no O
need O
to O

It's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B
in O
NYC O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red B
Eye I
Grill I

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B

We've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
NUM O
years O

The O
restaurant B
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O

The O
food B
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B
of I
herbs I
and I
tomatoes I

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O

It's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B
and I
hyde I
Pub I
last O
night O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O

The O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O

The O
place's O
decor B
and O
hidden B
bathrooms I
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
go O
and O
eat O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B
and I
Hyde I
Pub I
for O
our O
anniversary O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O

The O
have O
over O
NUM O
different O
beers B
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B
tortelini I

The O
entertainment B
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O

The O
bagel B
was O
huge O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream O
cheese O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicious O
the O
food B
and O
the O
service B
was O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
NUM O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B
roll I
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B
santa I
fe I
chopped I
salad I
and O
fish B
and I
chips I

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O
for O
their O
food B
the O
ambience B
and O
wonderful O
service B

All O
the O
staff B
is O
absolutely O
professional O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O

But O
they O
do O

that O
is O
A O
MUST O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
NUM O
or O
more O

This O
restaurant B
was O
way O
overhyped O

My O
chow B
fun I
and I
chow I
see I
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O

Okay O
- O
i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O

The O
scallion B
pancakes I
and O
fried B
dumplings I
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O

The O
service B
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B

It's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
and O
our O
sushi B
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
the O
tuna B
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B
had O
no O
flavor O

I O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
NUM O

Their O
pad B
penang I
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B
is O
poor O

fresh B
restaurant I
was O
amazing O
food B
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O

It O
was O
wonderful O

the O
salads B
are O
delicious O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O

We O
had O
Pam's B
special I
fried I
fish I
and O
it O
was O
amazing O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O

Unbelievable O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O

Great O
vibe B
lots O
of O
people O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
medium O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O

I O
didn't O
complain O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B
so O
much O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O

Ambience B
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O

Salads B
were O
fantastic O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B
we O
got O
were O
great O

Ingredients B
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O

We O
will O
be O
back O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
inexpensive O
sushi B

It O
costs O
NUM O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O

The O
spicy B
Tuna I
roll I
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O

The O
Yellowtail B
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B
you I
can I
eat I
deal I
however O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
NUM O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O

In O
any O
event O
this O
is O
a O
place B
I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O

things O

fast O
as O
they O
can O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O

efficiently O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
congee B
noodles I
and O
rice B
dishes I
are O
no O
more O
than O
NUM O
each O

The O
takeout B
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O

This O
place B
is O
always O
very O

my O
wife O

arugula B
and I

cheeseboth O
very O
tasty O

opted O
for O
a O
pasta B
dish I
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O

We O

an O
amazing O
time O

The O

delicious O
and O
the O
place B
is O
lovely O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O

Yes O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B
and O
ok O
service B

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B
and O
bad O
service B
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B
good O
and O
bad O
service O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O

The O
place O
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means: O
simple O
dishes B
and O
wine B
served O
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B

And O
where O
does O
Patis B
go O
wrong O
no O
where O

You O
are O
not O
eating O
haut O
cuisine O
with O
subtle O
hints O
of O
whatever O
but: O
Cassuolet O
Steake O
Fritte O
Tripe O
Stew O
etc O
simple O
stuff O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B
is O
simply O
wonderful O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place O
with O
good O
pizza B

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
raddichio B
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B
pizza I
which O
tasted O
better O

The O
sangria B
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
 
I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B
beer I
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O

MMmmm O
it O
was O
delicious O

Service B
was O
slow O
but O
the O
people B
were O
friendly O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O

I O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O

The O
food B
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O

Pizza B
is O
terrific O
as O
is O
homemade B
pasta I

Ambience B
is O
delightful O
service B
impeccable O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B

The O
hanger B
steak I
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O

Service B
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B
is O
not O
that O
great O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B
and O
service B
was O
excellent O

The O
filet B
mignon I
dish I
was O
superb O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O

It's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B
it's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O

The O
sushi B
is O
amazing O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O

Big O
thumbs O
up O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B
and I
noodle I
soup I
dishes I
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B

However O
I O
think O
this O
place B
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O

Next O
time O
we O
wouldn't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O

THe O
Pizza B
and O
wine B
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B
too O
- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B
dining I
area I

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor B
restaurants I
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
so O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O

Check O
this O
place B
out O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O

First O
of O
all O
this O
place B
is O
not O
romantic O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch's O
editorial O
review O

Either O
that O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
NUM O

The O
tables B
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
the O
menu B
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
and O
the O
wine B
list I
is O
simply O
overpriced O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B
start O
at O
NUM O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
NUM O

Service B
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O

For O
instance O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
etc O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
which O
was O
above O
average O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B
or I
orange I
flavoring I

Fish B
was O
overdone O

Cute O
place O
nice O
wait B
staff I
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B
- O
that's O
it O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment O

Myagi B
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
City O
the O
place O
the O
negative O
reviews O
describe O
sound O
like O
they O
were O
somewhere O
else O

I've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B
and O
the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O

Their O
tuna B
tartar I
appetizer I
is O
to O
die O
for O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O

The O
place O
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B
a O
try O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O

PS O
Please O
don't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O

LOL O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B
with O
great O
service B
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B

No O
gimmicks O
here O
- O
the O
food B
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O

The O
dining B
room I
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music O
to O
shout O
over O
- O
how O
refreshing O

The O
service B
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
the O
staff B
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
present O
your O
meal O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O

Looking O
around O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O

Beautiful O
experience O

The O
view B
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B
is O
top O
notch O
the O
ambiance B
is O
wonderful O

The O
staff B
offers O
impeccable O

Lobster B

Lobster O
in O
it O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B
England I
Chowder I
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B
Bisque I

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O

My O

good O

We O
didn't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B
of I
Korbett I
it O
was O
just O
enough O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O

it O

It's O

it's O
so O

taste O
it O

All O

this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B
vindaloo I

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
NUM O
class O
service B
and O
terrific O
food B

The O
portions B
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers O
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
excellent O

The O
food B
is O
amazing O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef's O
tasting O
menu O
and O
your O
favourite O
bottle O
or O
two O
 of O
wine O
from O
an O
extensive O
selection B
of I
wines I

The O
place O
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
but O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
a O
romantic O
date O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O

The O
food B
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B
fixe I
tasting I
menu I
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O

Recommendations O
of O
course O
are O
required O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon O
salad O
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
the O
food B
here O
was O
decent O
not O
great O

The O
menu B
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
NUM O
or O
NUM O
entrees O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
grilled B
branzino I
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O

The O
decor B
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
just O
simple O
small O
and O
sparse O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B
is O
particularly O
memorable O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O

This O
place B
is O
so O
much O
fun O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B
in O
a O
restaurant O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O

Our O
food B
was O
great O
too O

And O
really O
large O
portions B

The O
staff B
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B
and I
Hyde I

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O

The O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O

I O
am O
going O

The O
place B
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O

The O
characters B
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O

The O
food B
however O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O

However O
I O
think O
Jeckll B
and I
Hydes I
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O

Service B
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O

Drinks B
way O
over O
priced O

Food B
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Great O
pizza B
for O
lunch O
place O

Service B
was O

The O
pizza B
was O
great O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O

Have O
the O
iced O

Growing O
up O
in O

I O
have O

my O
share O
of O
bagels O

Ess-A-Bagel O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
NY O

The O
bagels B
always O
warm O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream O
cheeses O
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B
are O
great O

The O
lox B
is O
always O
fresh O
too O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O

I O
don't O
get O
it O
either O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant B

Zero O
ambiance B
to O
boot O

I O
thought O
this O
place B
was O
totally O
overrated O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
okbut O
definitely O
nothing O
great O

The O
ambience B
was O
nice O
but O
service B
wasn't O
so O
great O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
it O
just O
doesn't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
meespecially O
considering O
the O
prices O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu-Shabu B
Restaurant I

the O
Try-State O

I O
have O
lived O
in O

the O
taste O

the O

the O

in O
Japan O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu-Shabu B

The O
atmosphere B
is O
nothing O
special O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O

The O
owner B
and O
staff B
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O

ultra O
fresh O

said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O

We O
weren't O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B
and O
food B

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O

The O
location B
and O
ambience B
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O

me O

Try O

The O

also O
very O
good O
you O
will O

The O

The O

Moderate O

Ciao O
Bella O

I O
found O
the O
food B
service I
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O

The O
food B
was O
authentic O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O

Very O
good O

I O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O

Who O
has O

Great O
staff B

Always O
great O
service B

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O

Fantastic O

The O
food B
is O
good O
I O
can't O
lie O

But O
the O
staff B
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O

The O
hostess B
and O
the O
waitress B
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O

This O
place B
is O
pricey O
and O
yes O
the O
food B
is O
worth O
it O
but O
the O
service B
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short O

Amma B
is O
nothing O
special O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O

quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O

Will O
not O
be O
back O

Don't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B
dishes I
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg B
selections I

Decor B
is O
nice O
though O
service B
can O
be O
spotty O

This O
place B
is O
always O
packed O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O

Most O
importantly O
food B
is O
excellent O

Try O

Haru B

S I
is O
simply O
disgusting O

The O
fish B
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O

Quite O
frankly O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B
I O
have O
ever O
tried O

Will O
never O
be O
back O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O

believe O
us O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
NUM O
yrs O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O

the O
all-u-can-eat B
sushi I
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O

limited O
menu B
no-so-fresh O
ingredients B
thinly-sliced O
fish B
fall-apart O
rice B

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B
sauce I
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
the O
vinegar-soaked O
rice B
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O

the O
waitstaffs B
are O
nice O
though O

wont O

again O
for O
sure O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth's B
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O

The O
dinner B
was O
ok O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B
benedict I
for O
brunch O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O

With O
the O
theater O
NUM O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B

The O
service B
was O
attentive O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

Planet B
Thai I
is O
great O

We O
love O
the O
food B
drinks I
and O
atmosphere B

The O
svc B
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B
is O
a O
must O

Try O
the O
Pad B
Thai I
it's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O

Just O
because O
it's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B
is O
nasty O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O

Just O
remember O
the O
later O
you O
go O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O

It's O
popular O
w O
the O
late O
crowd O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
didn't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
and O
didn't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O

Also O
the O
sandwiches B
nearing O
NUM O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O

Overall O
not O
worth O
the O
money O

Eating O
in O
the O
atmosphere B
saves O
it O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
it's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O

Chennai B
Garden I
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B
at O
amazin O
prices O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT B
dishes I
whatsoever O

The O
seats B
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B
and O
it O
closes O
early O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B
bar I
and O
has O
great O
staff B

The O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B
sizes I
are O
appropriate O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O

Not O
a O
great O
place B
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O

LOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B

Food B
is O
excellent O

Fish B
is O
so O
very O
fresh O

Waitstaff B
are O
very O
friendly O

Love O
YUKA B

Mermaid O
Inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B

The O
menu B
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B
are O
excellent O

The O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B
with I
Scallops I
and I
Shrimp I
is O
great O

The O
service B
is O
good O
and O
ambience B
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B
is O
the O
prices O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O

The O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
NUM O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B
special I
my O
husband O
had O
steak B
and O
the O
service B
was O
top-notch O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B

Why O

They O
don't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer's O
health O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B
fish I
drunken I
chicken I
and O
the O
soupy B
dumplings I
certainly O
the O
stir B
fry I
blue I
crab I

The O
food B
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
nice O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B
remains O
excellent O

Cheese B
plate I
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
NUM O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B
paninis I
tramezzinis I
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O

The O
asparagus B
truffle O
oil O
parmesan O
bruschetta O
is O
a O
winner O
 
Wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over-priced O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
and O
always O
delicious O
specials B

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O

I O
loved O
this O
place B

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O

The O
food B
was O
very O
good O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
the O
place B
its O
self O
was O
great O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
freindly O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O

The O
service B
was O
terrible O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O

The O
waitress B
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
asked O
him: O
Where O
are O
you O
frommaybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
Americaand O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O

We O
did O
tip O
I O
guess O
the O
waitress B
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe O
Noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O

Pizza B
here O
is O
consistently O
good O

Salads B
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O

Decor B
is O
charming O

Service B
is O
average O

What O
a O
great O
place B

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O

The O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B
cuisine I

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B
service I
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O

A O
gentleman B
maybe O
the O
manager O
came O
to O
our O
table O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald's O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald's O
than O
this O
joint O

Never O
again O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O

Excellent O
atmosphere B
delicious O
dishes B
good O
and O
friendly O
service B

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
also O
really O
nice O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
NUM O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
food B
drinks I
staff I
mileau I

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B
over O
NUM O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
but O
both O
times O
the O
hostess B
didn't O
have O
my O
name O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B
table I

The O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B
bathroom I
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
the O
waitstaff B
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B
and O
fantastic O
service B

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B

Fresh O
ingredients B
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O

Friendly O
staff B
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O

I O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
outstanding O
particulary O
the O
salmon B
dish I
I O
had O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B
Mojito I
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B
sum I
which O
was O
goodnot O
outstanding O
but O
good O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B
patio I
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B
is O
hear O
well O
there O

Overall O
excellent O
restaurant B

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O

The O
food B
was O
good O

The O
place B
was O
nice O
and O
calm O

but O
the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O

The O
buffet B
had O
a O
nice O
selection O

The O
food B
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B

Service B
was O
also O
very O
good O

I O
would O
go O
back O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B
and O
they O
were O
huge O

But O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O

Consequently O
their O
burgers B
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O

Also O
they O
were O
NUM O
each O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B
sandwich I
on I
a I
roll I

It O
was O
NUM O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami O
- O
but O
it O
didn't O
have O
much O
taste O
- O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O

This O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
the O
food B

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
and O
the O
spice B
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O

And O
the O
Tom B
Kha I
soup I
was O
pathetic O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B

The O
pesto B
pizza I
was O
excellent O
thin-crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B
Italian I
cheese I
that O
I'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O

THe O
back B
garden I
sitting I
area I
is O
very O
pleasant O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B
sandwich I
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
the O
portion B
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B
fries I
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
wonderful O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B
that O
were O
just O
right O

We O
will O
be O
back O

love O
the O
food B

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B
comfort I
food I

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices O

highly O
recommended O

I've O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
NUM O
years O
and O
this O
place B
has O
it O
all O

Great O
food B
good O
size O
menu B
great O
service B
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B

The O
dishes B
offered O
were O
unique O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B
sausages I
sardines I
with I
biscuits I
large I
whole I
shrimp I
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B
ice I
cream I
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I've O
ever O
had O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
NUM O
Streets O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O

The O
freshest O
best O
variety O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B

Also O
very O
inexpensive O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost O
and O
a O
great O
deal O

The O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included: O
ceviche B
mix I
special I
crab I
dumplings I
assorted I
sashimi I
sushi O
and O
rolls B
two I
types I
of I
sake I
and O
the O
banana B
tempura I

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B
food I
but O
terrible O
delivery B

I've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O

A O
Thai B
restaurant I
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner O

The O
food B
arrived O
NUM O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O
cold O
and O
soggy O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O

An O
excellent O
service B

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
NUM O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O

The O
food B
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B
Jamun I
dessert I
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O

Service B
here O
was O
great O
food B
was O
fantastic O

Guacamole B
shrimp I
appetizer I
was O
really O
great O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B
very O
good O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B
that O
came O
with O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O

Maybe O
tomorrow O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B

The O
food B
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B
is O
quick O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B
but O
never O
loud O

Go O
here O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B
place I
to O
become O
overcrowded O

However O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O

By O
far O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
Manhattan O

The O
crust B
is O
thin O
the O
ingredients O
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
I O
say O
good O
- O
stay O
out O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O

The O
menu B
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O

The O
fish B
was O
reallyreally O
fresh O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia B
pizza I

It's O
to O
die O
for O

The O
food B
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
the O
waiter B
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
okay O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O

We O
weren't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
we're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B
plus O
great O
service B
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B
was O
outstanding O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O

The O
blond B
wood I
decor I
is O
very O
soothing O
the O
premium B
sake I
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B
is O
great O

Mizu B
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O

While O
their O
kitchen B
food I
is O
delicious O
their O
Sushi B
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B
the O
best O
around O
the O
service B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O

Warning: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B

Thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B
serving O
you O
but O
the O
food B
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B
salmon I
and I
roe I
appetizer I
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O

The O
entree B
was O
bland O
and O
small O
dessert B
was O
not O
inspired O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B

The O
view B
is O
spectacular O
and O
the O
food B
is O
great O

Wonderful O
strawberry B
daiquiries I
as O
well O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B
food I
that's O
cheap O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O

Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O

The O
cold B
appetizer I
dishes I
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O

delicious O
simple O
food B
in O
nice O
outdoor B
atmosphere I

Kind O
attentive O
wait B
staff I

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B
and O
the O
mahi B
mahi I
on I
saffron I
risotto I

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B
and I
mashed I
potatos I

Delicious O
crab B
cakes I
too O

Even O
if O
the O
food O
wasn't O
this O
good O
the O
garden B
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza O
place O
with O
good O
selection B
of I
thin I
crust I
pizza I
including O
the O
Basil O
slice O

Their O
calzones B
are O
horrific O
bad O
vomit-inducing O
YUCK O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O

The O
counter B
service I
is O
bad O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O

They're O
rude O
at O
times O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O

NO O
PIZZA B
NUM O
for O
me O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
where O
greasy O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O

The O
dosas B
are O
skimpy O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O

The O
sandwiches B
are O
dry O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O

Calling O
the O
place B
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O

Seriously O
this O
place B
kicks O
ass O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
unheralded O
the O
service B
impecible O
and O
the O
food B
magnificant O

Best O
Italian B
food I
I O
ever O
had O
and O
being O
Italian O
that O
means O
alot O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
peaceful O
place B
to O

The O

looks O
out O

beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O

the O

It O

The O
food B
is O
good O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B
dishes I
and O
the O
drinks B
are O
delicious O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O

by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

Murray O
won't O
do O
it O

Won't O
or O
Can't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B

So O
close O
but O
not O
good O
enough O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O

The O
service B
is O
awful O

This O
place B
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O

Also O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll O
if O
it's O
not O
on O
the O

you O
can't O
have O
it O

Love O
Pizza B
NUM O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
their O
Pizza B

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B
spot I
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O

The O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O

The O
cream B
cheeses I
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O

Bagels B
are O
ok O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B

the O
turkey B
burgers I
are O
scary O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese O
food O
I've O
ever O
encountered O

The O
soup B
for I
the I
udon I
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O

The O
sushi B
was O
awful O

The O
rice B
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O

Furthermore O
the O
rice B
had O
no O
seasoning O
so O
the O
sushi B
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O

The O
fish B
was O
adequate O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B
cuisine I

Good O
fast O
service B

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O

Food B
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O

The O
location B
is O
perfect O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O

Well O
this O
place B
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music O
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
NUM O
dollar O
bottle B
minimun O
then O
you'll O
love O
it O
here O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
sally O

Awsome O
Pizza B
especially O
the O
Margheritta B
slice I

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O

Great O
atmoshere B
and O
worth O
every O
bit O

Open O
late O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I'm O
a O
night O
person O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff B
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O

The O
food B
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O

For O
authentic O
Thai B
food I
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course O

Try O
the O
Pad B
Thai I
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B
menuthey're O
all O
delicious O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B
was O
special O

The O
service B
was O
attentive O
yet O
discreet O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O

The O
brioche B
and I
lollies I
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O

I'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O

The O
place B
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O

Service B
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B
and O
crab B
salad I
they O
are O
all O
good O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B
Strike I
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
pleasant O
fun O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
way O

The O
food B
is O
yummy O
especially O
their O
cooked-to-perfection O
mussels B
in I
spicy I
tomato I
sauce I
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B
night I
atmosphere I
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O
martini B
in O
a O
glass O
that's O
about O
NUM O
NUM O
NUM O
drinks O
for O
NUM O
I O
recommend O
the O
Vanilla B
Shanty I
mmmm O
 in O
a O
great O
homey O
setting B
with O
great O
music B

The O
in-house B
lady I
DJ I
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
and O
moreover O
takes O
requests O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B

Suan B
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
classmates O
too O

Its O
location B
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B
again O
and O
again O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B

noodles B
with I
shrimp I
and I
chicken I
and I
coconut I
juice I
is O
the O
MUST O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
NUM O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B
soon O

In O
summer O
- O
eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B
another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B
food I
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner O
location O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
NUM O
months O
the O
chef B
and O
staff B
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O

The O
food B
now O
is O
inconsistent O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O

The O
setting B
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O

The O
food B
is O
excellent O

if O
you're O
daring O
try O
the O
balsamic B
vinegar I
over I
icecream I
it's O
wonderful O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B
Go I
Hamburgers I
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
 NUM O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
is O
worth O
it O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O

The O
wait B
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B
is O
not O
your O
gig O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
for O
Chinatown O
alternative O

A O
few O
tips: O
skip O
the O
turnip B
cake I
roast I
pork I
buns I
and O
egg B
custards I

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner: O

NUM O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

NUM O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O

The O
food B
was O
exceptional O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
the O
braised B
lamb I
shank I
in I
red I
wine I
which O
was O
excellent O

The O
service B
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
casual O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B
decor I
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O

the O
pad B
se I
ew I
chicken I
was O
delicious O
however O
the O
pad B
thai I
was O
far O
too O
oily O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B
House I
several O
times O
and O
it's O
always O
good O

The O
fried B
dumplings I
are O
GREAT O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B
restaurant I

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B
service I

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
especially O
a O
small O
intimate O
one O
forget O
about O
it O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O

Terrible O
terrible O
management B
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O

delicious O
bagels B
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O

Spreads B
and O
toppings B
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O

Service B
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O

Been O
there O
done O
that O
and O
New O
York O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O

The O
food B
is O
decent O
at O
best O
and O
the O
ambience B
well O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O

Rao B
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
but O
it's O
nothing O
special O

I've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O

But O
after O
last O
night O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I'm O
eating O
indian B
cuisine I

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B
appetizers I

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O

This O
place O
has O
the O
correct O
ambience B
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O

Great O
food B
great O
prices O
great O
service B

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
cheap O
eats B
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amazing O
indian B
food I

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B
gives O
to O
the O
food O

also O
it's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O
place B
the O
service B
it's O
just O
perfectthey're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O

I O
love O
Ess-a-bagel O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray's O
for O
convenience O

Their O
bagels B
are O
fine O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special' O
bagel O
experience O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
in O
my O
opinion O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place O

Great O
bagels B
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O

Drawbacks: O
service B
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast O

The O
food B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

The O
baked B
clams I
octopus I
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we've O
ever O
had O

The O
lamb B
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
the O
dessert B
was O
divine O

The O
waiter B
was O
attentive O

The O
place B
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B
scene I
seems O
to O
be O
happening O

Downtown O

Appetizers B

i O
had O
salmon B
wasnt O
impressed O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B
it O
was O
good O

Dessert B
is O
a O
jokedont O
bother O

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
can't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B
is O
this O
friendly O

The O
restaurant B
has O
a O
Family O
feel O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B
which O
are O
enormous O
the O
veal B
alone O
could O
have O
single-handedly O
solved O
third O
world O
famine O

The O
anti-pasta B
was O
excellent O
especially O
the O
calamari B
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B
mains I

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B

Still O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own O
measures B
of I
liquers I
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O

Fantastic O
place B

Cute O
and O
decorative O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O

Lucky B
Strike I
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
but O
it O
shouldn't O

Great O
food B
great O
decor B
great O
service B

I O
recommend O
it O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B
for O
meeting O
friends O
having O
lunch O
dinner O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O

Always O
ask O

for O
the O
SEASONAL B
beer I

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O
 
Excellent O

Heartland B
Brewery I
for O
over O
NUM O
years O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O

All O

What O
a O
great O
place B

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B

A O
cool O
bar B
with O
great O
food B
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B

And O
even O
with O
it's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O

Loved O
it O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O

The O
shrimp B
scampi I
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B
were O
plentiful O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
drive O
to O
Corona B

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B
which O
is O
exceptional O
is O
the O
service B

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B
with O
only O
around O
NUM O
tables O
at O
most O

Service B
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O

Food B
was O
very O
good O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O

The O
porcini B
mushroom I
pasta I
special I
was O
tasteless O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B
tagliatelle I

A O
real O
dissapointment O

But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake: O
a O
tiramisu B
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B
ribs I
in O
the O
city O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B
dishes I
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B
rice I
porridge I

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O

However O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O

It's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O

When O
I'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St O
Bart's O

When O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B
dining I
room I
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B
you'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O

The O
food B
is O
wonderful O
tasty O
and O
filling O
and O
the O
service B
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B

Ahhh O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O

This O
little O
place O
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B
for O
your O
money O

The O
service B
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B
sauce I
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

They O
all O
know O
you O

Good O
food B

Good O
drink B

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B
like O
this O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O

Great O
spot B
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B
seating I
in O
the O
warmer O
months O

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion O
of O
wines B
at O
reasonable O
prices O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
we O
decided O
to O
try O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O

While O
the O
ambiance B
and O
atmosphere B
were O
great O
the O
food B
and O
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B
casserole I
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
all O
dark O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
bone O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B
was O
fine O
if O
not O
good O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B
beef I
and O
lamb B
dishes I

i O
don't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O

service B
is O
friendly O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O

i O
would O
recommend O

a O
few O
different O

this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O

The O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
the O
sauces B
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O

soggy O

Ravioli B

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O

overpriced O

Not O
enough O
wines B
by I
the I

either O

Service B

I O

Food B
was O
just O
averageif O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O

This O
place B
is O
a O
great O
bargain O

Authentic O

the O

was O
surprisingly O
excellent O

The O

so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O

to O
our O
delight O
they O
have O
outdoor B
seating I
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O

Indoor B
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O

The O
portion B
sizes I
here O
are O
huge O
and O
the O
sushi B
is O
good O

While O
it's O
not O
Nobu O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O

Staff B
is O
very O
accomodating O

Excellent O

which O
was O
great O

But O
NUM O
for O
each O
small O
piece O

Not O
worth O
it O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O

The O
decor B
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O

The O
portions B
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B
lasagna I
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B

The O

gave O
them O

and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O

Great O
food B
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O

The O
food B
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O

I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O

Try O

Service B

Just O
make O
sure O
my O

out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don't O
live O
in O
the O

definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O

Consistently O

Japanese B
Tapas I

Same O

Yakitori B

tasty O
too O

It's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel's O
Share O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
more O
romantic O
bar O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B
unfriendly O
staff B
and O
a O
sushi B
chef I
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O

Wasn't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligatedwhile O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O

proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O

No O
thanks O

This O
place B
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
is O
perhaps O
Queens' O
biggest O
secret O

Fabulous O
decor B
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
a O
trendy O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
very O
very O
good O
food B
cheaply-priced O
generally O
friendly O
staff B
and O
if O
you're O
a O
Manhattanite O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
Manhattan O
Rice B
Avenue I
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
homevery O
Soho O
Village O
Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clienteleall O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
NUM O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

We O
left O
never O
to O
return O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
I O
don't O
need O
overpriced O
food B
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait-staff B
who O
don't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
clumsy O
service B
and O
management B
that O
doesn't O
care O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
NUM O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
NUM O
street O
which O
is O
NUM O
blocks O
away O
on O
NUM O

a O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O

The O
food B
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O

They're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
Queens O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B
and O
a O
nice O
decor B
at O
reasonable O
prices O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B
and O
has O
no O
personality O

In O
fact O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
NUM O
pieces O

relatively O
good O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O

NUM O
for O
all B
you I
can I
eat I
sushi I
cannot O
be O
beaten O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
NUM O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B
are O
very O
attentive O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
NUM O
NUM O
year O
olds O
also O

The O
vibe B
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
service B
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

Food B
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B
of I
the I
new I

city I
skiline I
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B
by I
the I
window I

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O

the O

There O
is O
a O
downside O

the O

Never O

Over O
the O

always O
treated O
me O
as O
family-although O
with O
all O
the O

this O
not-so-little O
gem O

a O

not-so-frequent O
visitor O
