Excellent O
food B
although O
the O
interior B
could O
use O
some O
help O

The O

like O
an O

Delivery B

We've O
found O

comparable O
in O

Best O
Sushi B
Ever O

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O

Creative O
consistent O

Excellent O

Love O
it O

Very O
very O
nice O

The O
place B
is O
a O
bit O
hidden O
away O
but O
once O
you O
get O
there O
it's O
all O
worth O
it O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food B

Loved O
It O

My O
wife O

Edge O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O

The O
waiter B
was O
attentive O
the O
food B

delicious O
and O
the O
views B
of I
the I
city I
were O
great O

I'd O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O

Great O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O

Place B
is O
open O
till O
late O
no O
dress O
code O

Good O
food: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood O
spaghetti O

Highly O
recommended O

Excellent O
food B
for O
great O
prices O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O

The O
wait B
staff I
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating O

The O
space B
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
NUM O
minutes O
- O
NUM O
hour O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo-chinese B
food I

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O

the O
bestt O

my O
favorite O
place B
lol O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B
pasta I
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

its O
alright O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O

lobster B
was O
good O
nothing O
spectacular O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

I O
love O
this O
place B

I O
wasn't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
can't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O

The O
service B
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B
was O
nice O
and O
clean O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B
alla I
marsala I
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O

The O
veal B
and O
the O
mushrooms B
were O
cooked O
perfectly O

The O
potato B
balls I
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O

The O
only O
downside O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O

WORST O

know O
how O

make O
specific O

service B
was O
so O
slow O
the O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
waitresses B
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O

at O
the O

werent O
very O
attentive O

last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B
in O
New O
York O

My O
quesadilla B
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O

like O
the O
bartender O

forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O

Really O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds O
- O
this O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
at O

Best O
Indian B
Restaurant I

the O

the O
food B
is O
amazing O

This O
small O
Astoria O

what O
many O
consider O
the O

both O

out O

What O
really O

the O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O

a O

menu O
for O
NUM O
pp O

The O
wine B
list I
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff B
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O

The O
bread B
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
"free" O
appetizer B
of I
olives I
was O
disappointing O

However O
our O
main B
course I
was O
wonderful O

I O
had O
fish B
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O

The O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
pear B
torte I
was O
good O
- O
but O
once O
again O
the O
staff B
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B

All O
in O
all O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B
is O
great:it's O
romanticcozy O
and O
private O

The O
boths B
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they're O
perfect O
for O
NUM O
people O

The O
service B
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive O
thanks O
to O
the O
service B
button I
on O
your O
table O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
NUM O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B
took O
our O
order O

The O
food B
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O

over O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B
not O
the O
food B

Will O
prob O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O

Greg B
is O
my O
favorite O

Sometimes O
tables O
don't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B
who O
has O
personality O
professionalism O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B
remembers O
my O
order O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B
and O
bev B

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
servers B
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O

DINING O

WEST O

Stepping O

La I
Femme I
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O
York O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B
to O
the O
food B
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O

a O

and I
lime I
juice I
and I
mint I
leaves I
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O

Food B
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B
dancing I
show I
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B
is O
def O
worth O
commending O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O

The O
menu B
looked O
great O
and O
the O
waiter B
was O
very O
nice O
but O
when O
the O
food B
came O
it O
was O
average O

Nevertheless O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
and O
that's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B
sauce I
at O
the O
bottom O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
nothing O
was O
comped O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
but O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O

Yes O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O

The O
manager B
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
didn't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B

For O
a O
restaurant B
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O

The O

was O
pretty O

had O
a O

you're O

hey O
that's O
a O
good O

feels O
the O

can O
be O
somewhat O
over O

THE O
SERVICE B

AMAZING O
i've O
had O
different O
waiters B
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC O

The O

You O

get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
don't O
make O

Which O
lets O
face O
itat O
times O
it's O
a O
good O
thing O

In O

NOTHING O
BUT O

GREAT O

Highly O

One O

the O
best O
if O
not O
THE O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Park O
Slope O
and O
NY O
in O
general O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B
is O
great O

This O
establishment B
is O
the O
real O
deal O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places: O
intimate O
superb O
food B
homey O
top O

all O
the O
way O
around O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O

There O
is O
"Expensive-but-worth-it" O
and O
there O
is O
"Expensive-and-WTF" O

This O
is O
a O
twenty-something O
guy O
that O
doesn't O
mind O
laying O
down O
NUM O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
NUM O

But O
NUM O
for O
a O
dinner B
for I
two I
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me O

Look O
the O
appetizers B
were O
really O
good O

The O
entree B
was O
also O
very O
good O

Can't O
argue O
about O
that O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B
and O
the O
name O

Yes O
the O
place B
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O

Sashimi O

Which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
Kobe O
but O
Wagyu O
beef O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O

A O

Entrees: O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak O

Vanison B
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O

Bison B
was O
quite O
excellent O
however O

Dessert: O
pure O
disaster O

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O

I O
was O
wrong O

The B
Four I
Seasons I
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
but O
trust O
me O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
"I've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant" O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B
was O
great O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B

The O
environment B
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O

Yes O
it O
is O
good O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B
sadly O
no O

Service B
was O
just O
ok O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you'd O
expect O
for O
NUM O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money O
scammers O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B
La I
Femme I
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B
La I
Femme I
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B
for O
a O
table O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
NUM O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
NUM O
minutes O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O

The O
place B
is O
beautiful O

The O
hostess B
was O
very O
pleasant O

However O
our O
NUM O
drinks B
were O
were O
horrible O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
NUM O
NUM O
hour O
to O
NUM O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O

After O
the O
NUM O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O

My O
chicken B
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
NUM O
dinner B

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
NUM O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
NUM O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B
and O
belly O
dancers O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B
was O
inedible O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O

Don't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
NUM O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
NUM O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O

The O
hostess O
said O
"Wow O
that's O
a O
large O
group O
unless O
you O
aren't O
together" O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
"no O
we O
are O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please" O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O

The O
menu B
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B
that O
evening O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B
of I
bottled I
beer I
either O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B
oysters I
and I
clams I
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
NUM O
of O
each O

The O
lobster B
knuckles I
special O
of O
the O
day O
were O
ok O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
NUM O
shrimp O
in O
the O
salt B
encrusted I
shrimp I
appetizer I

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
which O
took O
all O
of O
NUM O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
NUM O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O

She O
replied O
"well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded" O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
so O
we O
did O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
NUM O
minutes O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B
style I
Fried I
Sea I
Basswhich O
was O
very O
good O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B
Mahi I
Mahi I
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B
roll I
was O
excellent O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
but O
fresh O

Service B
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
"large O
party" O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O

Great O
Indian B
food I

I O
lived O
on O
NUM O
st O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O

Food B
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O

Very O
"normal O
Indian B
food" O
but O
done O
really O
well O

I O
have O
it O
a O
NUM O
instead O
of O
NUM O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
NUM O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel O

Also O
waiters B
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
for O
Indian B
food I

One O
of O
the O
BEST O

Bukhara B
Grill I
the O
tagline O
says O
it O
all O
"INDIAN O
SPICE O
RAVE" O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara O
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O

The O
lunch B
buffet I
is O
expensive O
but O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O

We O
have O
gone O
for O
dinner O
only O
a O
few O
times O
but O
the O
same O
great O
quality O
and O
service B
is O
given O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B
an O
service B

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else's O
order O

Fine O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O

However O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean O
fair O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it's O
your O
only O
option O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
slimy O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O

My O
girlfriend O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O

Gorgeous O
place B
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white O
organza O
tent O
which O
included O
a O
four B
course I
prix I
fix I
menu I
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O

The O
service B
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa B
La I
Femme I
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
NUM O
minutes O
apart O

The O
bibimbap B
was O
average O
but O
the O
stone B
bowl I
wasn't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
NUM O
for O
the O
stone B
bowl I

The O
nakgi-bokum B
was O
horrible O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B
squid I
I've O
ever O
tasted O

The O
sauce B
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O

The O
side B
dishes I
were O
passable O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
wasn't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
NUM O
Street O
of O
course O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B
which O
was O
amazing O

It O
doesn't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O

The O
farro B
salad I
and O
the O
mashed B
yukon I
potatoes I
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O

i O
love O
margherita O
pizza O
- O
i O
love O
east B
village I

Love O
this O
place B
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go O

A O
quintessential O
slice B
of I
NYC I
pizza I

The O
crust B
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
the O
sauce B
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B
is O
great O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B
pizza I
better O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B
in O
the O
City O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B
Japanese I
brasserie I
that O
don’t O
serve O
sushi O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B
wooden I
doors I
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
decor B
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you’re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O

If O
you’re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you’ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B
booths I
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B
ceilings I
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
 
It’s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘excuse O
me’ O
before O
the O
waiter B
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B
fixe I
prix I
menu I
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B
amuse I
bouche I

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B
Black I
Cod I
as O
my O
entree O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B
Salmon I
dish I
was O
better O

The O
entrees B
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O

The O
sake B
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O

For O
desserts O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B
black I
sesame I
mousse I
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B
powdered I
green I
tea I
and I
blueberry I
cheesecake I
which O
was O
phenomenal O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
but O
I O
just O
can’t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B

I O
don’t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
what O
more O
twice O
but O
I’ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O

The O
service B
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O

We O
were O
NUM O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
NUM O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
NUM O
for O
some O
drinks B
and O
their O
pita B
bread I

Stay O
away O

Great O
Shabu B
Shabu I

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
particularly O
when O
it's O
cold O

I O
love O
it O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B
but O
wasn't O
too O
impressed O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B
Shabu I
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
shabu O
Tatsu O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O

The O
meat B
is O
fresh O
the O
sauces B
are O
great O
you O
get O
kimchi O
and O
a O
salad O
free O
with O
your O
meal O
and O
service B
is O
good O
too O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B
food I
and O
fusion B
twists I
like O
pork B
belly I
tacos I

The O
hot B
dogs I
are O
good O
yes O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B
croquette I
sandwich I
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O

The O
food B
tasted O
very O
good O

The O
family B
seafood I
entree I
was O
very O
good O

The O
main B
entree I
was O
also O
very O
good O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B
is O
good O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O

This O
place B
doesn't O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B
walls I
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O

This O
place B
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B
is O
totally O
weird O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B
tapas I
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
doesn't O
work O

The O
food B
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O

Good O
Food B

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O

The O
food B
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
sitting B
space I
was O
too O
small O
I O
don't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O

Over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place B

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
if O
possible O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O

The O
atmosphere B
was O
great O

The O
food B
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
although O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
margaritas B
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O

Our O
waitress B
wasn't O
mean O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
though O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O

Regardless O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O

Lexicographers O
take O
note: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O

The O
servers B
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O

A O
different O
server B
enhanced O
the O
fun O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B
which O
was O
delicious O

Overall O
the O
food B
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
hasn't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit-out B
some O
attractive O
furnishings B
and O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
a O
reasonable O
wine B
list I
I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O

At O
NUM O
for O
two O
people O
however O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
unless O
you're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture O

On O
that O
scale O
it's O
a O
world-beater O

How O
is O
this O
palce B
still O
open O

I O
honestly O
don't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B
and O
I O
was O
appalled O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B
and O
mashed O
potatoes O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
NUM O
salmon B
and O
I O
have O
never O
in O
the O
NUM O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
as O
dry O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O

At O
this O
point O
the O
waitress B
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything O
and O
guess O
what O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O

So O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach B
again O
but O
the O
spinach O
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O

I O
couldn't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O

I've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O

Guess O
what O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
she O
says O
"oh O
well O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier" O
No O
apology O
nothing O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
walked O
away O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O

No O
desert O
menu O
no O
apology O
nothing O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
but O
instead O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad: O
the O
manager B
said O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
didn't O
like O
it O
and O
I O
cannot O
comp O
it O

Again O
no O
apology O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
nothing O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O

The O
manager B
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
the O
drinks B
and O
appetizers B
and O
walked O
out O

I O

If O
I O

NUM O
stars O
I O

reason O
there O
are O
NUM O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O

in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
things O
are O
expensive O

However O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O

This O
placegod O
where O
do O
i O
begin O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B
i'll O
give O
them O
that O

The O
decor B
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
won't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
NUM O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B
that O
took O
NUM O
FRICKIN O

How O
this O
place B
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O

make O
your O

very O
happy O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O

I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B

But O
nonetheless O
- O
great O
spot B
great O
food B

Fabulous O
food B
- O
if O
the O
front B
of I
house I
staff I
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O

It's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
but O
we've O
eaten O
there O
NUM O
times O
in O
the O
last O
NUM O
years O

Each O
time O
we've O
been O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
not O
the O
waiters B
- O
they're O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish O
dishes O
I O
would O
never O
return O

As O
BFC B
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B
of I
house I
staff I
until O
you O
are O
seated O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B
with O
winged O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
NUM O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
"had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O

I'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O

There's O
another O
girl B
who O
I O
can't O
describe O
she O
is O
about O
NUM O
with O
brown O
hair O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you're O
really O
talking O
about O

I'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O

Again O
I'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
NUM O
a O
head O
I O
expect O
better O
service B

So O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O

Maitre-D B
- O
"Eat O
and O
get O
out" O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O

The O
food B
and O
service B
were O
fine O
however O
the O
maitre-D B
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B
of I
wine I
our O
son's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
NUM O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
including O
Paris O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B
in O
a O
restaurant O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
arrogant O
and O
condescending O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise: O
you O
can't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-D's O
sense O
of O
" O
table O
turnover" O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
or O
else O

If O
you O
go O
here O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off-night O

Best O
meal B
in O
a O
long O
time O

Mussles B
and O
calamari B
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B
special I
which O
was O
perfect O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B
steak I
which O
was O
very O
good O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O

The B
Four I
Seasons I
restaurant I
is O
a O
great O
experience O

The O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B
is O
even O
better O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O

Highly O
recommend O
it O

Taking O
Hot B
Dogs I
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
but O
at O
Bark B
you O
don't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B
dog I

Here O
the O
hot B
dog I
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O

Great O
Atmosphere B

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B
tacos I
everything O
else O
was O
ok O

Cool O
atmosphere B
the O
fire B
place I
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O

Poor O
service B
and O
management B

Don’t O
go O
to O
this O
place B

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B
la I
Femme I
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
another O
NUM O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O

The O
manager B
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O

On O
the O
way O
out O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O

Can’t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O

What O
a O
hassle O

The O
food B
is O
very O
good O
but O
not O
outstanding O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B
or O
the O
wait B
for O
a O
table O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O

Mistakes O
happen O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
don't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O

Wow O

The O
bread B
was O
stale O
the O
salad B
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O

The O
pasta B
was O
well O
cooked O
didn't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O

So O
rude O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O

Her O
review O
is O
above O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O

My O
friend O
is O
NUM O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O

The O
hostess B
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B
disappeared O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B
said O
"can O
I O
help O
you" O
and O
"how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party" O

What O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O

We O
didn't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B
and O
non-existent O
customer B
service I

bad O
staff B

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B

The O
food B
is O
good O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B
is O
good O

But O
the O
service B
is O
HORRID O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B
and O
a O
waiter B

The O
waiter B
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O

I O
can't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O

The O
waitress B
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O

I O
couldn't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
to O
clear O
the O
table O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B
more O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B
